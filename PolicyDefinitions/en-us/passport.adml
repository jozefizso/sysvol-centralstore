        <!-- DropdownList Button strings -->
        <string id="MSPassport_UsePassportForWorkExplain">Microsoft Passport for Work is an alternative method for signing into Windows using your Active Directory or Azure Active Directory account that can replace passwords, Smart Cards, and Virtual Smart Cards.

If you do not configure this policy setting, users can provision Microsoft Passport for Work which encrypts their domain password.

If you enable this policy, the device provisions Microsoft Passport for Work using keys or certificates for all users.

If you disable this policy setting, the device does not provision Microsoft Passport for Work for any user.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_RequireSecurityDevice">Use a hardware security device</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_RequireSecurityDeviceExplain">A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) provides additional security benefits over software because data stored within it cannot be used on other devices.

If you enable this policy setting, only devices with a usable TPM may provision Microsoft Passport for Work.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the TPM is still preferred, but all devices may provision Microsoft Passport for Work using software if the TPM is non-functional or unavailable.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_MinimumPINLength">Minimum PIN length</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_MinimumPINLengthExplain">Minimum PIN length configures the minimum number of characters required for the PIN.  The lowest number you can configure for this policy setting is 4.  The largest number you can configure must be less than the number configured in the Maximum PIN length policy setting or the number 127, whichever is the lowest.

If you configure this policy setting, the PIN length must be greater than or equal to this number.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the PIN length must be greater than or equal to 4.

NOTE: If the above specified conditions for the minimum PIN length are not met, default values will be used for both the maximum and minimum PIN lengths.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_MaximumPINLength">Maximum PIN length</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_MaximumPINLengthExplain">Maximum PIN length configures the maximum number of characters allowed for the PIN.  The largest number you can configure for this policy setting is 127. The lowest number you can configure must be larger than the number configured in the Minimum PIN length policy setting or the number 4, whichever is greater.

If you configure this policy setting, the PIN length must be less than or equal to this number.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the PIN length must be less than or equal to 127.

NOTE: If the above specified conditions for the maximum PIN length are not met, default values will be used for both the maximum and minimum PIN lengths.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_UppercaseLetters">Require uppercase letters</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_UppercaseLettersExplain">Use this policy setting to configure the use of uppercase letters in the Microsoft Passport for PIN.

If you enable this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work requires users to include at least one uppercase letter in their PIN.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work does not allow users to use uppercase letters in their PIN.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_LowercaseLetters">Require lowercase letters</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_LowercaseLettersExplain">Use this policy setting to configure the use of lowercase letters in the Microsoft Passport for PIN.

If you enable this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work requires users to include at least one lowercase letter in their PIN.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work does not allow users to use lowercase letters in their PIN.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_SpecialCharacters">Require special characters</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_SpecialCharactersExplain"><![CDATA[Use this policy setting to configure the use of special characters in the Microsoft Passport for PIN.  Allowable special characters are: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~ .

If you enable this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work requires users to include at least one special character in their PIN.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work does not allow users to use special characters in their PIN.]]>
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_Digits">Require digits</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_DigitsExplain">Use this policy setting to configure the use of digits in the Microsoft Passport for PIN.

If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work requires users to include at least one uppercase letter in their PIN.

If you disable this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work does not allow users to use digits in their PIN.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_PINHistory">History</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_PINHistoryExplain">This setting specifies the number of past PINs that can be associated to a user account that canâ€™t be reused. This policy enables administrators to enhance security by ensuring that old PINs are not reused continually. PIN history is not preserved through PIN reset.

The value must be between 0 to 50 PINs. If this policy is set to 0, then storage of previous PINs is not required.

Default: 0.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_PINExpiration">Expiration</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_PINExpirationExplain">This setting specifies the period of time (in days) that a PIN can be used before the system requires the user to change it. The PIN can be set to expire after any number of days between 1 and 730, or PINs can be set to never expire if the policy is set to 0.

Default: 0.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_UseBiometrics">Use biometrics</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_UseBiometricsExplain">Microsoft Passport for Work enables users to use biometric gestures, such as face and fingerprints, as an alternative to the PIN gesture. However users must still configure a PIN to use in case of failures.

If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work allows the use biometric gestures.

If you disable this policy setting, Microsoft Passport for Work prevents the use of biometric gestures.

NOTE: Disabling this policy prevents the user of biometric gestures on the device for all account types.
        </string>
        <string id="MSPassport_UseRemote">Use Remote Passport</string>
        <string id="MSPassport_UseRemoteExplain">Use this policy setting to configure use of Remote Passport. Remote Passport provides the ability for a portable, registered device to be usable as a companion device for desktop authentication. Remote Passport requires that the desktop be Azure AD joined and that the companion device has a Passport for Work PIN.

If you enable this policy setting, Remote Passport will be enabled and a portable, registered device can be used as a companion device for desktop authentication.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Remote Passport will be disabled and a portable, registered device cannot be used as a companion device for desktop authentication.
