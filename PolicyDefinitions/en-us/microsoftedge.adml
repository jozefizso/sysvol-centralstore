      <string id="HomePages">Configure Start pages</string>
      <string id="HomePages_Explain">This policy setting lets you configure one or more Start pages for domain-joined devices. Your employees won't be able to change this after you set it.

If you enable this setting, you can configure one or more Start pages. If this setting is enabled, you must also include URLs to the pages, separating multiple pages by using angle brackets in this format:
     &lt;support.contoso.com&gt;&lt;support.microsoft.com&gt;

Version 1703 or later: If you don't want to send traffic to Microsoft, you can use the &lt;about:blank&gt; value, which is honored for both domain- and non-domain-joined machines, when it's the only configured URL.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, your default Start pages are the webpages specified in App settings.
</string>

      <string id="DisableLockdownOfStartPages">Disable lockdown of Start pages</string>
      <string id="DisableLockdownOfStartPages_Explain">This policy setting lets you disable the lock down of Start pages, letting users modify the Start pages when the "Configure Start pages" setting is in effect.

        Note
        This setting only applies when you're using the “"Configure Start pages" setting.

        Important
        This setting can only be used with domain-joined or MDM-enrolled devices. For more info, see the Microsoft browser extension policy (aka.ms/browserpolicy). 

If you enable this setting, you can't lock down any Start pages that are configured using the "Configure Start pages" setting, which means that users can modify them.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, users can't change any Start pages configured using the "Configure Start pages" setting. The Start pages will remain locked down.</string>
      <string id="LockdownFavorites">Prevent changes to Favorites on Microsoft Edge</string>
      <string id="LockdownFavorites_Explain">This policy setting lets you decide whether employees can add, import, sort, or edit the Favorites list on Microsoft Edge.

If you enable this setting, employees won't be able to add, import, or change anything in the Favorites list. Also as part of this, Save a Favorite, Import settings, and the context menu items (such as, Create a new folder) are all turned off.

Important
Don't enable both this setting and the Keep favorites in sync between Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge setting. Enabling both settings stops employees from syncing their favorites between Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

If you disable or don't configure this setting (default), employees can add, import and make changes to the Favorites list.</string>

      <string id="AllowAddressBarDropdown">Allow Address bar drop-down list suggestions</string>
      <string id="AllowAddressBarDropdown_Explain">This policy setting lets you decide whether the Address bar drop-down functionality is available in Microsoft Edge. We recommend disabling this setting if you want to minimize network connections from Microsoft Edge to Microsoft services.

        Note: Disabling this setting turns off the Address bar drop-down functionality. Therefore, because search suggestions are shown in the drop-down, this setting takes precedence over the "Configure search suggestions in Address bar" setting.

        If you enable or don't configure this setting, employees can see the Address bar drop-down functionality in Microsoft Edge.

        If you disable this setting, employees won't see the Address bar drop-down functionality in Microsoft Edge. This setting also disables the user-defined setting, "Show search and site suggestions as I type".</string>
      <string id="AllowAutofill">Configure Autofill</string>
      <string id="AllowAutofill_Explain">This policy setting lets you decide whether employees can use Autofill to automatically fill in form fields while using Microsoft Edge. By default, employees can choose whether to use Autofill.

If you enable this setting, employees can use Autofill to automatically fill in forms while using Microsoft Edge.

If you disable this setting, employees can't use Autofill to automatically fill in forms while using Microsoft Edge.

If you don't configure this setting, employees can choose whether to use Autofill to automatically fill in forms while using Microsoft Edge.</string>

      <string id="AllowPopups">Configure Pop-up Blocker</string>
      <string id="AllowPopups_Explain">This policy setting lets you decide whether to turn on Pop-up Blocker. By default, Pop-up Blocker is turned on..

If you don't configure this setting, employees can choose whether to use Pop-up Blocker.</string>
      <string id="AllowSearchEngineCustomization">Allow search engine customization</string>
      <string id="AllowSearchEngineCustomization_Explain">This policy setting lets you decide whether users can change their search engine. If you disable this setting, users can't add new search engines or change the default used in the address bar.

Important
This setting can only be used with domain-joined or MDM-enrolled devices. For more info, see the Microsoft browser extension policy (aka.ms/browserpolicy).

If you disable this setting, Windows Defender SmartScreen is turned off and employees can't turn it on.

If you don't configure this setting, employees can choose whether to use Windows Defender SmartScreen.</string>
      <string id="AllowWebContentOnNewTabPage">Allow web content on New Tab page</string>
      <string id="AllowWebContentOnNewTabPage_Explain">This policy setting lets you configure what appears when Microsoft Edge opens a new tab. By default, Microsoft Edge opens the New Tab page.

If you enable this setting, Microsoft Edge opens a new tab with the New Tab page.

If you disable this setting, Microsoft Edge opens a new tab with a blank page. If you use this setting, employees can't change it.

If you don't configure this setting, employees can choose how new tabs appears.</string>
      <string id="ConfiguredFavorites">Provision Favorites</string>

Important

If you disable this setting, the Microsoft Compatibility List isn’t used during browser navigation.</string>
